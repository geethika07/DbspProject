## Instructions and Installation 

1. Install Yarn and NodeJS.

2. Frontend Setup: In /frontend, run yarn install for dependencies.
3. Backend Setup: Install Python 3.8+ and Poetry (pip install poetry). In /api, run poetry install for Python packages, using Flask.
4. Database Configuration:
Host: localhost
Database Name: TPC-H
User: postgres
Password: postgres
Port: 5432
PostgreSQL & TPC-H Dataset: Use pgAdmin to create a postgres user. Initialize tables and constraints in the database with psql -U postgres -f dss.ddl TPC-H - The commands will initialize empty tables in the database and psql -U postgres -f dss.ri TPC-H - This command will create the constraints on the tables, including initializing the primary keys and foreign keys on the various tables. Import CSV files into each table via pgAdmin. CSVs are available at the provided link.
